# Aeroelasticity

Minimal collection of MATLAB scripts developed during PhD research for aeroelastic analysis. A detailed project report is included in the repository.

## What this repo contains

- MATLAB scripts and functions used for analyses and simulations.
- A detailed project report (see the report file in the repository).
- Supporting data files used by the scripts.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2018a and later)
- Optional: MATLAB toolboxes required by specific scripts (Signal Processing, Control System, etc.)

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudhipv/aeroelasticity.git
cd aeroelasticity
```

2. Open MATLAB and add the repository to the path:
```matlab
addpath(genpath(pwd))
```

3. Run a script from the MATLAB command window:
```matlab
run('example_script.m') % replace with the script you want to run
```
